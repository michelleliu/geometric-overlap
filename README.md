Geometric Overlap method for accessibility of porous material to a nonspherical probe

In the examples file, you will find the following files needed to run:
- cif file
- UFF.rad, a list of radii to use for Zeo++

Make sure that the `network` executable points to the correct Zeo++ executable

Run the scripts in `scripts/` from the `examples/` folder as the working directory, in the order of their numerical prefixes (0, 1, 2). All of the outputs should appear in the `examples/` folder
